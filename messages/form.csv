11/6/2023 11:27:51,Someone I dated a while back ,"I’m sorry things didn’t work out but I think about you and hope you’re doing well, you’re a great person! "
11/6/2023 12:24:01,Grandma,"I’m sorry I wasn’t around for the last few months you were still with us. I was away at school and every time I came back I was afraid of seeing you get sicker and smaller, even though I used to love spending time with you and knew there wasn’t much of it left. I was still too young to understand all of that. You were the best grandmother a kid could have. Thank you for loving me."
11/6/2023 13:28:15,Mom,"Hello, Mom.
I'm not doing as well as you might think. I miss home, my family, and the food and environment of my hometown.
But I made a big decision to come here, and I don't want to worry you by being too honest about how difficult it is to be far from you and Dad, so I've been pretending to be strong.
I probably won't admit how tough it was even when you see my face.
Nevertheless, this time will pass, and I won't have to lie anymore because I'll actually be okay."
11/6/2023 18:03:00,Baba,I want you to know that I really did try my best. I still do try my best.
11/13/2023 13:00:12,My mom,Thank you for giving me life and teaching me to live
11/13/2023 13:01:28,My friend Yixin,"I always enjoy spending time with you and want to cook more meals, watch more movies, take more walks, read more books…together. But now I just wish you pursue whatever you want and be free. And maybe one day we could wander freely together "
11/13/2023 13:01:37,Dad,You finally made it and went on therapy. Thank you. 
11/13/2023 13:01:47,To you: ,I realized that I actually don’t feel emotionally safe around you ~ makes me question being in relationship with you 
11/13/2023 13:25:56,My dog,Behave yourself!
11/13/2023 13:45:33,Mom,I hope you won't be so anxious. plz spend more time and energy on yourself. You're my favorite person in the world！

11/13/2023 13:50:04,Mz,I’m really sorry. If there’s a second chance I would not let you down anymore

11/15/2023 5:59:25,The moon,"I’m sorry, I should have loved you the way you wanted maybe then I could still reach you"
11/27/2023 13:29:42,My mom,"I wish I had told my mom back in college how I really felt about her angry response to my change in career paths. She made it seem as if the change I was making was negatively affecting her and that in doing this I was disappointing her in a way that made me ultimately lie about and hide the full extent of what I was doing. I look back on it now as something that really negatively affected my relationship with her and my own mental health at the time and I really wish I had stuck up for myself more. Instead, I don’t think she’ll ever really be involved in my life the same way again. "
11/27/2023 13:34:03,Past roommate,I so wish I would’ve told my single bad roommate to be kinder. She was so rude to anyone that came into the apartment and I never got to hear from her why she acted that way. It was a full year of awkward silences and passive aggression and I just know if I had had the confidence to properly address things I could’ve worked things out or at least gotten a full reason for why she felt so annoyed with everything I did when I was truly trying my best to be a good roommate. 
11/27/2023 13:42:03,A bunch of people I've met in the past couple of years,Are you doing anything right now? Let's do something together.
11/27/2023 14:34:31,mother,"if you keep talking shit about us, you will lose us at all"
